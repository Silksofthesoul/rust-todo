%APP-NAME%: %APP-VER%

This program allows you to make a todo list. You can also mark completed tasks,
as well as export your lists to .md and .html formats.

At the moment the program exists only in the version for windows.
This program is being developed as part of my study of programming in the Rust language.

To use the program everywhere and without specifying the extension,
add the path to the program to the environment variable "path".

You can also customize the display of columns in your list using the `todo set excludedColumns "Created,Ended"` command,
where you can list the names of the columns that you do not need to show, separated by commas.

If you have any questions or suggestions on using this program,
